# DEPI Lorem Restaurant Website

This project was developed as part of the graduation project for the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**. The goal was to design a visually appealing, user-friendly platform for a restaurant. The website serves as an information hub, showcasing the menu, customer testimonials, and essential contact details.

- **Menu with Categories**: Organized into categories like Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, and Offers, making it easy to navigate.
- **Contact Us Form**: Includes a simple form for customers to get in touch with the restaurant.
- **Individual Product Pages**: Each meal has a dedicated page, providing detailed descriptions and a list of ingredients.

## Technologies Used
